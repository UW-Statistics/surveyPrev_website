# R Shiny App v1.1.0 Released: Explore the Latest Features!

We are excited to share the following updates on the R Shiny App:

- **Indicator Definition Alignment with DHS**: <br>Each supported indicator is now directly linked to the official list maintained by the DHS. You can access the official list <a href="https://api.dhsprogram.com/rest/dhs/indicators?returnFields=IndicatorId,Label,Definition&f=html" target="_blank">here</a>. We ensure that all indicators utilize standardized definitions provided by DHS.

- **Direct Estimate Alignment with DHS**: <br>A new checking panel has been added to allow users to verify that our direct estimates at national level consistently match those reported by DHS. This feature enhances the accuracy and reliability of the indicator coding.

- **User Experience Improvements**: <br>We have introduced a landing page with detailed step-by-step instructions. This resource will guide users through the R Shiny App's features and functionalities, improving overall usability.
