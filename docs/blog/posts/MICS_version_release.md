# R Shiny App for MICS Released!

We are excited to introduce the <a href="https://rsc.stat.washington.edu/surveyPrevRShinyMICS/" target="_blank">**MICS version**</a> of our Shiny app! This version keeps the core functionalities of the DHS-based app but currently supports a limited set of countries and indicators due to restricted access to geographical data and the absence of standardized coding schemes for individual indicators. However, we plan to expand coverage over time.

The MICS version only has the web-based access, which host data internally on our secure server, eliminating the need for manual uploads.
