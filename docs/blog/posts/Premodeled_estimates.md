# New Web-Based Tool for Pre-Calculated Estimates!

Weâ€™re excited to introduce a new web-based tool that delivers <a href="https://sae4lmic.stat.uw.edu/" target="_blank">**pre-calculated estimates**</a> for a selected list of indicators across limited countries.

The application compiles results from our R Shiny app, powered by the SAE workflow, and presents them through a suite of intuitive visualizations.

If your country is not yet included, let us know - weâ€™re open to expanding coverage.

ðŸ‘‰ Access the tool here: <a href="https://sae4lmic.stat.uw.edu/" target="_blank">https://sae4lmic.stat.uw.edu/</a>
