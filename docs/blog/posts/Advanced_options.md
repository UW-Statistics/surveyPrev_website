# Advanced Option Feature Now Available!

The **Advanced Options** panel allows users to customize modeling choices by enabling a nested model, which mitigates oversmoothing when data are sparse, and by incorporating area-level covariates to improve prediction. Users can customize these features after completing the initial data sparsity check step.

Details about the nested model and covariate incorporation can be found in the [Model Extension](../../method/model_extensions.md) section.
