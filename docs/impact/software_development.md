Our research team has developed a suite of R packages and tools to support advanced, accessible statistical analysis for health and demographic research. While the SAE4Health platform is centered on the [**`sae4health`**](../overview/app_general.md) R Shiny app and built primarily on methods from the <a href="https://github.com/richardli/surveyPrev" target="_blank">**`surveyPrev`**</a> package, it is part of a broader software framework developed to meet the needs of both technical and applied audiences.

- We have been working on <a href="https://github.com/richardli/SUMMER" target="_blank">**`SUMMER`**</a> package since 2017 – focuses mostly on mortality estimation.
- <a href="https://github.com/richardli/surveyPrev" target="_blank">**`surveyPrev`**</a> (*Richard*, *Qianyu*, *Yunhan*, *Andrea*, *Jon*) is on CRAN and allows SAE for binary indicators.
- Experience from UN and WHO workshops in Ecuador, South Africa, Malawi, and Rwanda is that researchers need a more user-friendly interface – to this end, the [**`sae4health`**](../overview/app_general.md) R Shiny app has been developed by *Yunhan* and was premiered in a [**WHO workshop**](../impact/WHO_workshop_series.md) in Rwanda June 2024.
- U5MR is hard because the data model is complex – can be done in <a href="https://github.com/richardli/SUMMER" target="_blank">**`SUMMER`**</a>.
- With *Ben Mayala*, *Yunhan*, *Richard*, *Jon*, and others, created a <a href="https://github.com/wu-thomas/SUMMER-DHS" target="_blank"> **pipeline**</a> for U5MR using DHS data and <a href="https://github.com/richardli/SUMMER" target="_blank">**`SUMMER`**</a>.
- R <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html" target="_blank">**`survey`**</a>  package </a> now has a generic <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/vignettes/survey-sae.html" target="_blank">**SAE module**</a> thanks to <a href="https://peteragao.github.io/" target="_blank">*Peter Gao*</a> and others.
