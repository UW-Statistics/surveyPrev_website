## App Description

We offer a web-based application that provides pre-calculated demographic and health estimates for a selected list of countries and indicators, based on the two most recent Demographic Health Surveys (DHS). Estimates are produced using weighted and small area estimation (SAE) methods, ensuring reliability at both national and subnational levels by accounting for the DHS sampling design and smoothing over areas with sparse data.

The app includes interactive maps and ridge plots that visualize both point estimates and their uncertainty—helping users interpret data precision across regions.
