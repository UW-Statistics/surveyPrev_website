We have introduced a version of the app that supports MICS (Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys) data. Currently, it supports a limited selection of countries and indicators. We are actively working on expanding our database to include more countries and a broader set of indicators.

## Accessibility

The MICS version of the app is exclusively available through the web-based version, deployed on an online server. This ensures that access is streamlined and only requires an internet connection and a web browser. **No data uploads are necessary** as all MICS data are preloaded into the system.

### Web-based R Shiny App

Access the MICS version of the R Shiny app directly via the following URL:
