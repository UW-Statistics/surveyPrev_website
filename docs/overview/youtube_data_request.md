## DHS Data Preparation

Before using the App, the user needs access to the required DHS survey data. DHS maintains strict data access rules, particularly for sensitive GPS-tagged data needed for SAE analysis.

Follow these steps to obtain access to DHS datasets (instruction videos available below):

- **Register an account**: Start by creating an account on the <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/Data/" target="_blank">DHS website</a> .
- **Provide project information**: Complete the forms with specific details about the project.
- **Request survey access**: Post-registration, formally request access to the country/year specific survey datasets. Be sure to request **GPS data**; approval typically occurs within 48 hours.
