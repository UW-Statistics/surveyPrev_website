For the past decade, our research team has engaged in extensive methodological work in Small Area Estimation (SAE) to enhance the accuracy of child mortality and prevalence estimates in regions with sparse data. This ongoing research includes developing and validating models that are critical for accurately assessing health indicators, especially in LIMCs. Our validated methodologies have been published in peer-reviewed journals, providing valuable insights for both academic research and practical applications.
