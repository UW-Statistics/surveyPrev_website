 abstract={We present a new package in R implementing Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). The package introduces many new features for data analysis using BART such as variable selection, interaction detection, model diagnostic plots, incorporation of missing data and the ability to save trees for future prediction. It is significantly faster than the current R implementation, parallelized, and capable of handling both large sample sizes and high-dimensional data.},

abstract = {The Bayes estimator of a small area mean is shown to have strictly smaller mean squared error (MSE) than that of the corresponding best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) for the Kleffe-Rao model, an extended mixed model with random sampling variances. The model is then extended to incorporate sampling weights, covariances and unequal sample sizes. A hierarchical Bayesian procedure which takes into account various sources of variabilities has been proposed. A specific small area estimation problem using data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey is considered. Based on a robust (i.e., model free) evaluation criterion, the proposed hierarchical Bayes estimator turns out to be superior to both estimated BLUP and the direct survey estimators. The posterior variances which measure the accuracy of the hierarchical Bayes estimates are always smaller than the corresponding variances of the direct survey estimates. The current state of estimated BLUP theory is not rich enough to provide reliable estimates of the MSE of the estimated BLUP for the example considered in this article.},

@article{Ye2012,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In the developed world, information on vital events is routinely collected nationally to inform population and health policies. However, in many low-and middle-income countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a lack effective and comprehensive national civil registration and vital statistics system.In the past decades, the number of Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSSs) has increased throughout SSA. An HDSS monitors births, deaths, causes of death, migration, and other health and socio-economic indicators within a defined population over time. Currently, the International Network for the Continuous Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH) brings together 38 member research centers which run 44 HDSS sites from 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Oceana. Thirty two of these HDSS sites are in SSA. DISCUSSION: This paper argues that, in the absence of an adequate national CRVS, HDSSs should be more effectively utilised to generate relevant public health data, and also to create local capacity for longitudinal data collection and management systems in SSA. If HDSSs get strategically located to cover different geographical regions in a country, data from these sites could be used to provide a more complete national picture of the health of the population. They provide useful data that can be extrapolated for national estimates if their regional coverage is well planned.HDSSs are however resource-intensive. Efforts are being put towards getting them linked to local or national policy contexts and to reduce their dependence on external funding. Increasing their number in SSA to cover a critical proportion of the population, especially urban populations, must be carefully planned. Strategic planning is needed at national levels to geographically locate HDSS sites and to support these through national funding mechanisms. SUMMARY: The paper does not suggest that HDSSs should be seen as a replacement for civil registration systems. Rather, they should serve as a short- to medium-term measure to provide data for health and population planning at regional levels with possible extrapolation to national levels. HDSSs can also provide useful lessons for countries that intend to set up nationally representative sample vital registration systems in the long term.},

Traditional designs, which compare areas with and without a given programme, are no longer relevant at a time when many programmes are being scaled up in virtually every district in the world. We propose an evolution in evaluation design, a national platform approach that: uses the district as the unit of design and analysis; is based on continuous monitoring of different levels of indicators; gathers additional data before, during, and after the period to be assessed by multiple methods; uses several analytical techniques to deal with various data gaps and biases; and includes interim and summative evaluation analyses. This new approach will promote country ownership, transparency, and donor coordination while providing a rigorous comparison of the cost-effectiveness of different scale-up approaches.},

	Abstract = {Registration of births, recording deaths by age, sex and cause, and calculating mortality levels and differentials are fundamental to evidence-based health policy, monitoring and evaluation. Yet few of the countries with the greatest need for these data have functioning systems to produce them despite legislation providing for the establishment and maintenance of vital registration. Sample vital registration (SVR), when applied in conjunction with validated verbal autopsy procedures and implemented in a nationally representative sample of population clusters represents an affordable, cost-effective, and sustainable short- and medium-term solution to this problem. SVR complements other information sources by producing age-, sex-, and cause-specific mortality data that are more complete and continuous than those currently available. The tools and methods employed in an SVR system, however, are imperfect and require rigorous validation and continuous quality assurance; sampling strategies for SVR are also still evolving. Nonetheless, interest in establishing SVR is rapidly growing in Africa and Asia. Better systems for reporting and recording data on vital events will be sustainable only if developed hand-in-hand with existing health information strategies at the national and district levels; governance structures; and agendas for social research and development monitoring. If the global community wishes to have mortality measurements 5 or 10 years hence, the foundation stones of SVR must be laid today.},

This report discusses how integrated continuous surveys and quality management (I-Q), which are well-recognized approaches in wealthy countries, could support intervention scale-up, monitoring and evaluation, quality control for commodities, capacity building, and implementation research in low-resource settings. Integrated continuous surveys are similar to existing national cross-sectional surveys of households and health facilities, except data are collected over several years by permanent teams, and most results are reported monthly at the national, province, and district levels. Quality management involves conceptualizing work as processes, involving all workers in quality improvement, monitoring quality, and teams that improve quality with "plan-do-study-act" cycles. Implementing and evaluating I-Q in a low-income country would provide critical information on the value of this approach.},

@article{Murray2010,
	Abstract = {One of the fundamental building blocks for determining the burden of disease in populations is to reliably measure the level and pattern of mortality by age and sex. Where well-functioning registration systems exist, this task is relatively straightforward. Results from many civil registration systems, however, remain uncertain because of a lack of confidence in the completeness of death registration. Incomplete registration systems mean not all deaths are counted, and resulting estimates of death rates for the population are then underestimated. Death distribution methods (DDMs) are a suite of demographic methods that attempt to estimate the fraction of deaths that are registered and counted by the civil registration system. Although widely applied and used, the methods have at least three types of limitations. First, a wide range of variants of these methods has been applied in practice with little scientific literature to guide their selection. Second, the methods have not been extensively validated in real population conditions where violations of the assumptions of the methods most certainly occur. Third, DDMs do not generate uncertainty intervals.},

@article{Lawn2011,
	Abstract = {Despite increasing attention and investment for maternal, neonatal, and child health, stillbirths remain invisible-not counted in the Millennium Development Goals, nor tracked by the UN, nor in the Global Burden of Disease metrics. At least 2·65 million stillbirths (uncertainty range 2·08 million to 3·79 million) were estimated worldwide in 2008 (≥1000 g birthweight or ≥28 weeks of gestation). 98\% of stillbirths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, and numbers vary from 2·0 per 1000 total births in Finland to more than 40 per 1000 total births in Nigeria and Pakistan. Worldwide, 67\% of stillbirths occur in rural families, 55\% in rural sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where skilled birth attendance and caesarean sections are much lower than that for urban births. In total, an estimated 1·19 million (range 0·82 million to 1·97 million) intrapartum stillbirths occur yearly. Most intrapartum stillbirths are associated with obstetric emergencies, whereas antepartum stillbirths are associated with maternal infections and fetal growth restriction. National estimates of causes of stillbirths are scarce, and multiple (>35) classification systems impede international comparison. Immediate data improvements are feasible through household surveys and facility audit, and improvements in vital registration, including specific perinatal certificates and revised International Classification of Disease codes, are needed. A simple, programme-relevant stillbirth classification that can be used with verbal autopsy would provide a basis for comparable national estimates. A new focus on all deaths around the time of birth is crucial to inform programmatic investment.},

They also need better epidemiological evidence about the relevance of physical (such as blood pressure and obesity), behavioral (such as smoking, alcohol, HIV-1 risk taking, and immunization history), and biological (such as blood lipids and gene polymorphisms) measurements to the development of disease in individuals or disease rates in populations. We report here on the rationale, design, and implementation of the world's largest prospective study of the causes and correlates of mortality.},

@article{Ye2012,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In the developed world, information on vital events is routinely collected nationally to inform population and health policies. However, in many low-and middle-income countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is a lack effective and comprehensive national civil registration and vital statistics system.In the past decades, the number of Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSSs) has increased throughout SSA. An HDSS monitors births, deaths, causes of death, migration, and other health and socio-economic indicators within a defined population over time. Currently, the International Network for the Continuous Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH) brings together 38 member research centers which run 44 HDSS sites from 20 countries in Africa, Asia and Oceana. Thirty two of these HDSS sites are in SSA. DISCUSSION: This paper argues that, in the absence of an adequate national CRVS, HDSSs should be more effectively utilised to generate relevant public health data, and also to create local capacity for longitudinal data collection and management systems in SSA. If HDSSs get strategically located to cover different geographical regions in a country, data from these sites could be used to provide a more complete national picture of the health of the population. They provide useful data that can be extrapolated for national estimates if their regional coverage is well planned.HDSSs are however resource-intensive. Efforts are being put towards getting them linked to local or national policy contexts and to reduce their dependence on external funding. Increasing their number in SSA to cover a critical proportion of the population, especially urban populations, must be carefully planned. Strategic planning is needed at national levels to geographically locate HDSS sites and to support these through national funding mechanisms. SUMMARY: The paper does not suggest that HDSSs should be seen as a replacement for civil registration systems. Rather, they should serve as a short- to medium-term measure to provide data for health and population planning at regional levels with possible extrapolation to national levels. HDSSs can also provide useful lessons for countries that intend to set up nationally representative sample vital registration systems in the long term.},

	Abstract = {Evaluation of large-scale programmes and initiatives aimed at improvement of health in countries of low and middle income needs a new approach. Traditional designs, which compare areas with and without a given programme, are no longer relevant at a time when many programmes are being scaled up in virtually every district in the world. We propose an evolution in evaluation design, a national platform approach that: uses the district as the unit of design and analysis; is based on continuous monitoring of different levels of indicators; gathers additional data before, during, and after the period to be assessed by multiple methods; uses several analytical techniques to deal with various data gaps and biases; and includes interim and summative evaluation analyses. This new approach will promote country ownership, transparency, and donor coordination while providing a rigorous comparison of the cost-effectiveness of different scale-up approaches.},

	Abstract = {Registration of births, recording deaths by age, sex and cause, and calculating mortality levels and differentials are fundamental to evidence-based health policy, monitoring and evaluation. Yet few of the countries with the greatest need for these data have functioning systems to produce them despite legislation providing for the establishment and maintenance of vital registration. Sample vital registration (SVR), when applied in conjunction with validated verbal autopsy procedures and implemented in a nationally representative sample of population clusters represents an affordable, cost-effective, and sustainable short- and medium-term solution to this problem. SVR complements other information sources by producing age-, sex-, and cause-specific mortality data that are more complete and continuous than those currently available. The tools and methods employed in an SVR system, however, are imperfect and require rigorous validation and continuous quality assurance; sampling strategies for SVR are also still evolving. Nonetheless, interest in establishing SVR is rapidly growing in Africa and Asia. Better systems for reporting and recording data on vital events will be sustainable only if developed hand-in-hand with existing health information strategies at the national and district levels; governance structures; and agendas for social research and development monitoring. If the global community wishes to have mortality measurements 5 or 10 years hence, the foundation stones of SVR must be laid today.},

	Abstract = {Well-funded initiatives are challenging developing countries to increase health intervention coverage and show impact. Despite substantial resources, however, major obstacles include weak health systems, a lack of reasonably accurate monitoring data, and inadequate use of data for managing programs. This report discusses how integrated continuous surveys and quality management (I-Q), which are well-recognized approaches in wealthy countries, could support intervention scale-up, monitoring and evaluation, quality control for commodities, capacity building, and implementation research in low-resource settings. Integrated continuous surveys are similar to existing national cross-sectional surveys of households and health facilities, except data are collected over several years by permanent teams, and most results are reported monthly at the national, province, and district levels. Quality management involves conceptualizing work as processes, involving all workers in quality improvement, monitoring quality, and teams that improve quality with "plan-do-study-act" cycles. Implementing and evaluating I-Q in a low-income country would provide critical information on the value of this approach.},

@article{Murray2010,
	Abstract = {One of the fundamental building blocks for determining the burden of disease in populations is to reliably measure the level and pattern of mortality by age and sex. Where well-functioning registration systems exist, this task is relatively straightforward. Results from many civil registration systems, however, remain uncertain because of a lack of confidence in the completeness of death registration. Incomplete registration systems mean not all deaths are counted, and resulting estimates of death rates for the population are then underestimated. Death distribution methods (DDMs) are a suite of demographic methods that attempt to estimate the fraction of deaths that are registered and counted by the civil registration system. Although widely applied and used, the methods have at least three types of limitations. First, a wide range of variants of these methods has been applied in practice with little scientific literature to guide their selection. Second, the methods have not been extensively validated in real population conditions where violations of the assumptions of the methods most certainly occur. Third, DDMs do not generate uncertainty intervals.},

@article{Lawn2011,
	Abstract = {Despite increasing attention and investment for maternal, neonatal, and child health, stillbirths remain invisible-not counted in the Millennium Development Goals, nor tracked by the UN, nor in the Global Burden of Disease metrics. At least 2·65 million stillbirths (uncertainty range 2·08 million to 3·79 million) were estimated worldwide in 2008 (≥1000 g birthweight or ≥28 weeks of gestation). 98\% of stillbirths occur in low-income and middle-income countries, and numbers vary from 2·0 per 1000 total births in Finland to more than 40 per 1000 total births in Nigeria and Pakistan. Worldwide, 67\% of stillbirths occur in rural families, 55\% in rural sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where skilled birth attendance and caesarean sections are much lower than that for urban births. In total, an estimated 1·19 million (range 0·82 million to 1·97 million) intrapartum stillbirths occur yearly. Most intrapartum stillbirths are associated with obstetric emergencies, whereas antepartum stillbirths are associated with maternal infections and fetal growth restriction. National estimates of causes of stillbirths are scarce, and multiple (>35) classification systems impede international comparison. Immediate data improvements are feasible through household surveys and facility audit, and improvements in vital registration, including specific perinatal certificates and revised International Classification of Disease codes, are needed. A simple, programme-relevant stillbirth classification that can be used with verbal autopsy would provide a basis for comparable national estimates. A new focus on all deaths around the time of birth is crucial to inform programmatic investment.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND TO THE DEBATE: Demographic surveillance--the process of monitoring births, deaths, causes of deaths, and migration in a population over time--is one of the cornerstones of public health research, particularly in investigating and tackling health disparities. An international network of demographic surveillance systems (DSS) now operates, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Thirty-eight DSS sites are coordinated by the International Network for the Continuous Demographic Evaluation of Populations and Their Health (INDEPTH). In this debate, Daniel Chandramohan and colleagues argue that DSS data in the INDEPTH database should be made available to all researchers worldwide, not just to those within the INDEPTH Network. Basia Zaba and colleagues argue that the major obstacles to DSS sites sharing data are technical, managerial, and financial rather than proprietorial concerns about analysis and publication. This debate is further discussed in this month's Editorial.},

Frequent national-level data are considered essential, even if their depth and quality are questionable. However, quality in-depth data from local sentinel populations may be better than scanty national data, if such local data can be considered as nationally representative. The difficulty is the lack of any theoretical or empirical basis for demonstrating that local data are representative where data on the wider population are unavailable. Thus these issues can only be explored empirically in a complete individual dataset at national and local levels, relating to a LMIC population profile.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: In countries where routine vital registration data are scarce, Demographic Surveillance Sites (DSS: locally defined populations under longitudinal surveillance for vital events and other characteristics) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS: periodic national cluster samples responding to cross-sectional surveys) have become standard approaches for gathering at least some data. This paper aims to compare DSS and DHS approaches, seeing how they complement each other in the specific instance of child and adolescent mortality in Ethiopia. METHODS: Data from the Butajira DSS 1987-2004 and the Ethiopia DHS rounds for 2000 and 2005 formed the basis of comparative analyses of mortality rates among those aged under 20 years, using Poisson regression models for adjusted rate ratios. RESULTS: Patterns of mortality over time were broadly comparable using DSS and DHS approaches. DSS data were more susceptible to local epidemic variations, while DHS data tended to smooth out local variation, and be more subject to recall bias. CONCLUSION: Both DSS and DHS approaches to mortality surveillance gave similar overall results, but both showed method-dependent advantages and disadvantages. In many settings, this kind of joint-source data analysis could offer significant added value to results.},

Seven questions were addressed when the evaluation was designed: who would be in charge, through what mechanisms IMCI could affect child health, whether the focus would be efficacy or effectiveness, what indicators would be measured, what types of inference would be made, how costs would be incorporated, and what elements would constitute the plan of analysis. We describe how these questions were answered, the challenges encountered in implementing the evaluation, and the 5 study designs.

	Abstract = {Despite findings indicating that both national income level and income inequality are each determinants of public health, few have studied how national income level, poverty and inequality interact with each other to influence public health outcomes. We analyzed the relationship between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power parity, extreme poverty rates, the gini coefficient for personal income and three common measures of public health: life expectancy, infant mortality rates, and tuberculosis (TB) mortality rates. Introducing poverty and inequality as modifying factors, we then assessed whether the relationship between GDP and health differed during times of increasing, decreasing, and decreasing or constant poverty and inequality. Data were taken from twenty-two Latin American countries from 1960 to 2007 from the December 2008 World Bank World Development Indicators, World Health Organization Global Tuberculosis Database 2008, and the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean. Consistent with previous studies, we found increases in GDP have a sizable positive impact on population health. However, the strength of the relationship is powerfully influenced by changing levels of poverty and inequality. When poverty was increasing, greater GDP had no significant effect on life expectancy or TB mortality, and only led to a small reduction in infant mortality rates. When inequality was rising, greater GDP had only a modest effect on life expectancy and infant mortality rates, and no effect on TB mortality rates. In sharp contrast, during times of decreasing or constant poverty and inequality, there was a very strong relationship between increasing GDP and higher life expectancy and lower TB and infant mortality rates. Finally, inequality and poverty were found to exert independent, substantial effects on the relationship between national income level and health. Wealthier is indeed healthier, but how much healthier depends on how increases in wealth are distributed.},

For countries currently without adequate mortality reporting systems there are useful models other than resource-intensive population-wide medical certification. Sample-based mortality surveillance is one such approach. This paper provides methods for addressing appropriate sample size considerations in relation to mortality surveillance, with particular reference to situations in which prior information on mortality is lacking.},

	Abstract = {Estimates of mortality in children less than five years old using government civil registration statistics (passive surveillance) were compared against statistics generated by active demographic surveillance during a randomized controlled trial of permethrin-treated bed nets (ITNs) in western Kenya. Mortality rates were two-fold lower when estimated through civil registration compared with active prospective surveillance (rate ratio [RR] = 0.51, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44-0.59). While civil registration underestimated deaths, particularly in the neonatal period, the age distribution of deaths in children 1-59 months of age was the same as with active surveillance. Seasonal mortality trends were also similar. There was no agreement between cause of death recorded by active and passive surveillance. Verbal autopsy estimated that half of all deaths were associated with malaria and pneumonia, but civil registration markedly under-reported these illnesses; incidence RR (95\% CI) = 0.18 (0.14-0.24), and 0.05 (0.03-0.08), respectively, while over-reporting deaths due to measles (RR = 15.5 [95\% CI = 7.3-33.2]). Government statistics under-represent mortality, particularly neonatal mortality, in children less than five years of age in rural areas of Kenya. They can provide accurate information on the age-distribution of deaths among children 1-59 months old, and on seasonal trends, but not on disease-specific mortality.},

	Abstract = {The burden of chronic, non-communicable diseases in low-income and middle-income countries is increasing. We outline a framework for monitoring of such diseases and review the mortality burden and the capacity of countries to respond to them. We show data from WHO data sources and published work for prevalence of tobacco use, overweight, and cause-specific mortality in 23 low-income and middle-income countries with a high burden of non-communicable disease. Data for national capacity for chronic disease prevention and control were generated from a global assessment that was done in WHO member states in 2009-10. Although reliable data for cause-specific mortality are scarce, non-communicable diseases were estimated to be responsible for 23·4 million (or 64\% of the total) deaths in the 23 countries that we analysed, with 47\% occurring in people who were younger than 70 years. Tobacco use and overweight are common in most of the countries and populations we examined, but coverage of cost-effective interventions to reduce these risk factors is low. Capacity for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, including monitoring and surveillance operations nationally, is inadequate. A surveillance framework, including a minimum set of indicators covering exposures and outcomes, is essential for policy development and assessment and for monitoring of trends in disease. Technical, human, and fiscal resource constraints are major impediments to the establishment of effective prevention and control programmes. Despite increasing awareness and commitment to address chronic disease, concrete actions by global partners to plan and implement cost-effective interventions are inadequate.},

@article{AbouZahr2007,
	Abstract = {Good public-health decision making is dependent on reliable and timely statistics on births and deaths (including the medical causes of death). All high-income countries, without exception, have national civil registration systems that record these events and generate regular, frequent, and timely vital statistics. By contrast, these statistics are not available in many low-income and lower-middle-income countries, even though it is in such settings that premature mortality is most severe and the need for robust evidence to back decisionmaking most critical. Civil registration also has a range of benefits for individuals in terms of legal status, and the protection of economic, social, and human rights. However, over the past 30 years, the global health and development community has failed to provide the needed technical and financial support to countries to develop civil registration systems. There is no single blueprint for establishing and maintaining such systems and ensuring the availability of sound vital statistics. Each country faces a different set of challenges, and strategies must be tailored accordingly. There are steps that can be taken, however, and we propose an approach that couples the application of methods to generate better vital statistics in the short term with capacity-building for comprehensive civil registration systems in the long run.},

	abstract = {Introduction Many national and subnational governments need to routinely measure the completeness of death registration for monitoring and statistical purposes. Existing methods, such as death distribution and capture-recapture methods, have a number of limitations such as inaccuracy and complexity that prevent widespread application. This paper presents a novel empirical method to estimate completeness of death registration at the national and subnational level. Methods Random-effects models to predict the logit of death registration completeness were developed from 2,451 country-years in 110 countries from 1970–2015 using the Global Burden of Disease 2015 database. Predictors include the registered crude death rate, under-five mortality rate, population age structure and under-five death registration completeness. Models were developed separately for males, females and both sexes. Findings All variables are highly significant and reliably predict completeness of registration across a wide range of registered crude death rates (R-squared 0.85). Mean error is highest at medium levels of observed completeness. The models show quite close agreement between predicted and observed completeness for populations outside the dataset. There is high concordance with the Hybrid death distribution method in Brazilian states. Uncertainty in the under-five mortality rate, assessed using the dataset and in Colombian departmentos, has minimal impact on national level predicted completeness, but a larger effect at the subnational level. Conclusions The method demonstrates sufficient flexibility to predict a wide range of completeness levels at a given registered crude death rate. The method can be applied utilising data readily available at the subnational level, and can be used to assess completeness of deaths reported from health facilities, censuses and surveys. Its utility is diminished where the adult mortality rate is unusually high for a given under-five mortality rate. The method overcomes the considerable limitations of existing methods and has considerable potential for widespread application by national and subnational governments.},

We report on the extent of testing and test results during the month of March in NYS, along with risk factors, outcomes, and household prevalence among initial cases subject to in-depth investigations.Specimen collection for COVID-19 testing was conducted in healthcare settings, community-based collection sites, and by home testing teams. Information on demographics, risk factors, and hospital outcomes of cases was obtained through epidemiological investigations and an electronic medical records match, and summarized descriptively. Active testing of initial case’s households enabled estimation of household prevalence.During March In NYS, outside of New York City, a total of 47,326 persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, out of 141,495 tests (33\\% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through March 12, by March 30 13\\% were hospitalized and 2\\% died. Testing conducted among 498 members of these case’s households found prevalent infection among 57\\%; excluding first-reported cases 38\\%. In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23\\% among those \\&lt;5 years to 68\\% among those ≥65 years (p\\&lt;.0001).New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020. The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.}",

	Abstract = {Penalized splines (P-splines) and individual random effects are used
        for the analysis of spatial count data. P-splines are represented
        as mixed models to give a unified approach to the model estimation
        procedure. First, a model where the spatial variation is modelled
        by a two-dimensional P-spline at the centroids of the areas or regions
        is considered. In addition, individual area-effects are incorporated
        as random effects to account for individual variation among regions.
        Finally, the model is extended by considering a conditional autoregressive
        (CAR) structure for the random effects, these are the so called "Smooth-CAR"
        models, with the aim of separating the large-scale geographical trend,
        and local spatial correlation. The methodology proposed is applied
        to the analysis of lip cancer incidence rates in Scotland. (c) 2008

	Abstract = {In recent years, spatial and spatio-temporal modelling have become
        an important area of research in many fields (epidemiology, environmental
        studies, disease mapping, etc.). However, most of the models developed
        are constrained by the large amounts of data available. We propose
        the use of penalized splines (P-splines) in a mixed model framework
        for smoothing spatio-temporal data. Our approach allows the consideration
        of interaction terms which can be decomposed as a sum of smooth functions
        similarly as an analysis of variance decomposition. The properties
        of the bases used for regression allow the use of algorithms that
        can handle large amount of data. We show that on imposing the same
        constraints as in a factorial design it is possible to avoid identifiability
        problems. We illustrate the methodology for Europe ozone levels in
        the period 1999-2005.},

Deaths were stratified by covis-19 status, location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors.Results 372 participants were enrolled between June and September 2020; PCR results were available for 364 (97.8\%). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 58/364 (15.9\%) according to the recommended cycle threshold value of \&lt;40 and in 70/364 (19.2\%) when expanded to any level of PCR detection. The median age at death among people with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was 48 (interquartile range 36-72) years, and 69\% (n=48) were male. Most deaths in people with covid-19 (51/70; 73\%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 before death. Among the 19/70 people who died in hospital, six were tested before death. Among the 52/70 people with data on symptoms, 44/52 had typical symptoms of covid-19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested before death. Covid-19 was identified in seven children, only one of whom had been tested before death. The proportion of deaths with covid-19 increased with age, but 76\% (n=53) of people who died were aged under 60 years. The five most common comorbidities among people who died with covid-19 were tuberculosis (22; 31\%), hypertension (19; 27\%), HIV/AIDS (16; 23\%), alcohol misuse (12; 17\%), and diabetes (9; 13\%).Conclusions Contrary to expectations, deaths with covid-19 were common in Lusaka. Most occurred in the community, where testing capacity is lacking. However, few people who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of covid-19. Therefore, cases of covid-19 were under-reported because testing was rarely done not because covid-19 was rare. If these data are generalizable, the impact of covid-19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.},

	abstract = {Introduction During March-December 2020, Zambia recorded 20,725 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with the first wave peaking between July and August. Of the 388 COVID-19-related deaths occurring nationwide, most occurred in the community. We report findings from COVID-19 mortality surveillance among community deaths brought to the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) mortuary in Lusaka.Methods In Zambia, when a person dies in the community, and is brought into a health facility mortuary, they are recorded as {\textquoteleft}brought in dead{\textquoteright} (BID). The UTH mortuary accepts persons BID for Lusaka District, the most populated district in Zambia. We analyzed data for persons BID at UTH during 2020. We analyzed two data sources: weekly SARS-CoV-2 test results for persons BID and monthly all-cause mortality numbers among persons BID. For all-cause mortality among persons BID, monthly deaths during 2020 that were above the upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval for the historic mean (2017-2019) were considered significant. Spearman{\textquoteright}s rank test was used to correlate the overall percent positivity in Zambia with all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing among persons BID at UTH mortuary.Results During 2020, 7,756 persons were BID at UTH (monthly range 556-810). SARS-CoV-2 testing began in April 2020, and through December 3,131 (51.9\%) of 6,022 persons BID were tested. Of these, 212 (6.8\%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive with weekly percent test positivity ranging from 0-32\%, with the highest positivity occurring during July 2020. There were 1,139 excess persons BID from all causes at UTH mortuary in 2020 compared to the 2017-2019 mean. The monthly number of persons BID from all causes was above the upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval during June-September and December.Conclusion Increases in all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among persons BID at UTH mortuary corresponded with the first peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in June and August 2020, indicating possible increased mortality related to the COVID-19 epidemic in Zambia. Combining all-cause mortality and SARS-CoV-2 testing for persons BID provides useful information about the severity of the epidemic in Lusaka and should be implemented throughout Zambia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research project has been supported by the President{\textquoteright}s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the terms of a cooperative agreement with the Zambia Ministry of Health (CoAg ID number: GH002234; CoAg name: Ministry of Health; CoAg principle investigator: Lloyd B.

Two-thirds of global deaths are not recorded or given a cause. Not knowing exactly what kills people makes it hard to design, test and implement effective public health interventions, and this results in more people suffering and dying. Working with the ALPHA Network of HIV surveillance sites in Africa, this project develops new methods and improves existing methods for understanding which causes of death account for the majority of deaths in populations that do not have traditional vital statistics systems.  The results of this project will provide the potential to better understand the important causes of death and assess the impact of interventions designed to prevent them.\\[4pt]

\textit{Abstract \& Notes}\\[4pt]
Two-thirds of global deaths are not recorded or given a cause. Not knowing exactly what kills people makes it hard to design, test and implement effective public health interventions, and this results in more people suffering and dying. Working with the ALPHA Network of HIV surveillance sites in Africa, this project develops new methods and improves existing methods for understanding which causes of death account for the majority of deaths in populations that do not have traditional vital statistics systems.  The results of this project will provide the potential to better understand the important causes of death and assess the impact of interventions designed to prevent them.\\[4pt]

The United Nations publishes updated estimates and projections of the populations of all the world's countries, broken down by age and sex. These are widely used by international organizations, governments, the private sector and researchers, for example for climate modeling and for assessing progress towards the Millenium Development Goals. The UN's current projections are deterministic, but assessing Uncertainty about population estimates and projections is important for policy-making and other purposes. We propose to develop a fully probabilistic population projection methodology.\\[4pt]
