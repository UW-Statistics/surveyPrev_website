The <code>surveyPrev</code> package and accompanying shinyapp is designed to produce small area prevalence estimates using household survey data. The household data are collected with a complex design (stratified, cluster sampling) and this must be recognized in the modeling. To this end, methods from survey sampling and SAE are used for modeling.</p> <p>Once small area estimates are produced, they may be mapped to see a visual picture of the pattern of prevalence over the study region.

In general, the numbers of Admin-1 and Admin-2 areas shows large variation across countries.</p> <p>In the context of household surveys, the usual sampling is stratified two-stage cluster sampling. We note that surveys in some countries deviate from the following description, but most Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) surveys follow this design. The strata are based on a cross-classification of urban/rural with Admin-1 areas. In the first stage, clusters are samples within strata, using probability proportional to size (PPS), with the sizes being the numbers of households.

As with the area-level model, the area-specific prevalences across areas are linked via a hierarchical model. Again, the rationale is that the similarity of prevalences across the study region may be leveraged to fine-tune the estimates in each area.

But the rationale for the approach is that the gain in precision will offset the shrinkage bias.
