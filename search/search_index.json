However, at more granular levels like Admin-3, these methods often fail to provide accurate estimates, a limitation we will explore through the following map for the same indicator (contraceptive usage among women aged 15-49 in Rwanda). </p> <p>Notably, about a third of the regions had no data at all, represented by grey coloring, leading to uncalculated estimates. This occurs in direct estimates methods because estimation here depend solely on region-specific data, unlike in the unit-level model which borrows information from neighboring regions. In areas with available data, direct estimation still presents challenges. Specifically, when data come from a limited number of clusters, prevalence estimates may reach extreme values of zero or one, and standard methods for calculating standard errors become inapplicable due to small sample sizes. This inability to validly measure uncertainty is indicated by the grey hatching in these regions. Furthermore, for regions with valid estimates, the associated uncertainties are often very high, making points estimate less reliable. </p> <p>This considerable uncertainty and the potential unreliability of these estimates at fine spatial scale necessitate caution in interpretation.

By comparing curves acorss regions, we can identify areas where estimates are notably higher or lower in an informal yet informative way. Overlapping curves suggest that the estimates are not significantly different when accounting for uncertainty, while distinct, non-overlapping curves indicate clear differences between regions. </p> <p>To enhance visual clarity, we avoid comparing too many regions at once, as this would result in a cluttered display.

Yet producing accurate estimates at the subnational level in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often demands advanced statistical modeling and complex software implementation \u2014 resources that are typically out of reach for the local policymakers and practitioners who know the health systems best.</p> <p>SAE4Health is a capacity-building initiative developed by researchers at the University of Washington to bridge this gap. It brings together training, statistical methodology, and accessible tools to make small area estimation (SAE) usable by all audiences. At the center is the user-friendly <code>sae4health</code> R Shiny application, which enables hands-on modeling and visualization of subnational health estimates \u2014 without requiring any programming expertise.</p> <p>The <code>sae4health</code> app draws on statistical methods implemented in the <code>surveyPrev</code>  R package and supports both DHS-based (DHS version) and MICS-based (MICS version) workflows. Users can use household survey data and generate SAE-based estimates across different administrative levels through an interactive interface.</p> <p>SAE4Health is designed not only to produce actionable subnational estimates, but also to build local capacity in statistical reasoning, enabling users to better understand, interpret, and apply model-based results in real-world policy and planning contexts.</p>"},{"location":"overview/project_overview/#target-audience","title":"Target Audience","text":"<p>SAE4Health is designed for institutions and individuals involved in subnational health data analysis and decision-making, including but not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>Ministries of Health using data for planning and monitoring.</li> <li>National Statistics Offices responsible for producing official health estimates.</li> <li>Subnational policymakers at the district or provincial level.</li> <li>Researchers and universities applying SAE methods in training and public health research.</li> <li>Health program implementers who use local estimates to guide interventions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"overview/project_overview/#core-objectives","title":"Core Objectives","text":"<p>SAE4Health supports country-led efforts to strengthen subnational health data use through:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Capacity building: Train national teams to apply SAE methods and interpret results for planning and policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data-informed planning: Support the development of strategies guided by model-based estimates across diverse health indicators.</p> </li> <li> <p>Knowledge exchange: Facilitate cross-country learning and build a network of technical experts for sustained use.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"overview/project_overview/#methodological-details","title":"Methodological Details","text":"<p>The statistical approach behind SAE4Health is centered on advanced SAE methodology, as described in the methods section.
